# fimfic-tracker

An unnecessary CLI application for tracking stories on [**Fimfiction**](https://www.fimfiction.net/). Because I'm weird and needed an easy way to track some stories without using my account.

Since it's working for me well enough, and that I really had a ton of fun making it, I thought: *Why not share it?*

## Installation

**Having Python installed is required, at least the 3.7 version.**

Use **pip** to install this project to your system.

```text
# Windows
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ZodiacalComet/fimfic-tracker.git

# Linux
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/ZodiacalComet/fimfic-tracker.git
```

Or you can use [**pipx**](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx#install-pipx) instead, which is my personal preference for this kind of Python applications.

```text
pipx install git+https://github.com/ZodiacalComet/fimfic-tracker.git
```

Alternately, you could clone this repository with git and install it locally.

```text
git clone https://github.com/ZodiacalComet/fimfic-tracker.git
cd fimfic-tracker

# With pip
python3 -m pip install .

# With pipx
pipx install -e .
```

## Usage

First thing to do is add a story to the tracking list, since there is none at this point, you use the `track` command like so:

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BHa6Nr9.png"></p>

It accepts an unlimited amount of arguments, which means that you can add multiple stories to the tracking list at the same time.

Now that you have some stories tracked, you can use the `download` command anytime to check for updates:

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/feolL9v.png"></p>

The downloaded files end up by default in `~/.fimfic-tracker/downloads`.

> Use with moderation, since the most probable you will end up making a lot of requests to the page for each use.

Want to stop tracking a story for whatever reason? You need the ID of the story, which can be seen with the `list` command:

Now knowing the ID you use the `untrack` command and, like with the `track` command, you can specify more than one at once:

## Configuration

The application searches for a `settings.py` file inside `~/.config/fimfic-tracker` and then in `~/.fimfic-tracker`.

Copy the following template, uncomment and edit to your preferences.

```py
#from pathlib import Path

## Paths
# Path to a directory in which to save the downloaded stories.
# Type: Path
#DOWNLOAD_DIR = Path.home() / ".fimfic-tracker" / "downloads"

# Path to store the tracker file.
# Type: Path
#TRACKER_FILE = Path.home() / ".fimfic-tracker" / "track-data.json"

## Download
# The format in which to download the stories. The valid values are:
# + ".txt"
# + ".html"
# + ".epub"
# Type: str
#DOWNLOAD_FORMAT = ".txt"

# The seconds to wait before advancing to the next story.
# Type: int or float
#DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 1

## Colors
# The color to use for text in certain output. The list of valid values can be
# found at: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/api/#click.style
# All of them are of type str.

#INFO_FG_COLOR = "bright_cyan"
#SUCCESS_FG_COLOR = "bright_green"
#ERROR_FG_COLOR = "bright_red"
#CONFIRM_FG_COLOR = "bright_white"

#HIGHLIGHT_TEXT_COLOR = "bright_green"
#HIGHLIGHT_NUMBER_COLOR = "bright_blue"
#HIGHLIGHT_OTHER_COLOR = "bright_white"
```
